## Git Commands

```bash
$ git clone <repo>                  # clone repo to current directory
$ git add                           # git add --all to stage all changes
$ git commit -m                     # commit any staged files
$ git push                          # push changes to remote repo
$ git pull                          # pull changes from remote repo
$ git status                        # check any stages, unstaged or untracked files
$ git log                           # check commit log
$ git checkout "branch"             # switch to branch
$ git checkout -b "branch_name"     # create a new branch
$ git push -u origin "branch_name"  # initialise new branch in remote repo
$ git merge "branch_name"           # merge branch_name to main branch
```

## Javascript

Javascript is a high level, dynamically typed, interpreted, object-oriented language that is massively used in web development.

#### Node

- NodeJS is a command line interface that **interprets** Javascript code within a runtime environment that is built on Google's V8 engine.
- NodeJS is an **interpreted language** instead of a compiled language, meaning it is compiled and run as part of the same step.

#### Variables, Printing

```js
const name = "Denton"; // Constant value that cannot be changed
let age = 18; // Variable type, can be changed from numbers to strings etc.
console.log(name, age); // Does on a newline
```

#### Strings

Can use either ' ' or " " for strings in js, when you need to mix variables and strings use `` to create a string literal

```js
// Normal String Example
let sentence = "My";
sentence = sentence + " name is";
sentence += " Pikachu";
console.log(sentence);

// String literal Example
const age = 7;
const myname = "Pikachu";
const phrase = `My name is ${myname} and I am ${age}`;
console.log(phrase);
```

#### Other

`if, else if, else, while` are very similar to C.

#### For in and For of loops

- For In statement loops through the properties of an array.
- For Of statement loops through the values of an array.

```js
for (const i in items) {
  console.log(items[i]);
}

for (const item_i of items) {
  console.log(item_i);
}
```

#### Objects

- Objects are variables that contain many name: values pairs.
- `const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};`
- Normally declared with `const`

Can access elements in a object by `object.element` or `object['element']`

## npm (node package manager)

```bash
npm init                    # setup a repo to use npm, creates a package.json file
npm install [dependency]    # install a dependency, creates a node_modules directory
```

`package.json` - Stores meta data about the project including a list of dependencies to install (committed to git).

`package-lock.json` - Stores versioning information about dependencies to ensure everyone has the right versions (committed to git).

`node_modules/` - Location of dependencies installed locally (not commited to git).

create a `.gitignore` file and add files that are untracked.

If you are working as a team, when you `git pull`, also run `npm install` to update the `package.json` file.

#### Importing Libraries 

```js
// importing external libraries
import module from "path";

// export locally to another file (can only be used once)
// can rename in the import file 
export default module;
import module from "path";

// named export (for multiple functions)
export { module_one, module_two };
import { module_one, module_two as renamedmod_one } from "path";
```

## Data interchange formats
To enable this standard interface for data, we have data interchange formats:
- `JSON` 
- `YAML`
- `XML`

#### JSON
- No trailing commas
- Object keys must include " "
```json
{
"locations": [ 
  {
    "suburb" : "Kensington",
    "postcode": 2033
  }, 
  { 
    "suburb" : "Mascot",
    "postcode": 2020
  }, 
  { 
    "suburb" : "Sydney CBD",
    "postcode": 2000
  }
 ]
}
```

- `JSON.stringify(data_structure)` to convert code to JSON strings
- `fs.writeFileSync('file.json', data, { flag: 'w' })` to write
- `fs.readFileSync('file.json', { flag: 'r' })` to read
- `JSON.parse(data_structure)` to covert the JSON strings to code
